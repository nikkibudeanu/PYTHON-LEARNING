# A common use for the modulo operator is when we need to find out if numbers are odd or even. An even number is always divisible by 2 so % 2 will always return 0 for even and 1 for odd. The modulo is also used when working with time if we wanted to convert minutes into hours and minutes. For example, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so if we wanted to figure out how many minutes are leftover once we convert 10900 minutes into hours, we would use 10900 % 60. The modulo returns an integer. If we recall the division operator returns a float. What if we wanted to do some division that returns an integer instead? In that case, we would use the floor division operator. The floor division operator is // and it rounds the result down to the nearest whole number and returns it as an integer.
